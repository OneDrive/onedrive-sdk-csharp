# OneDrive API Browser Sample

The OneDriveAPIBrowser sample is a [Windows Forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd30h2yb(v=vs.110).aspx) app sample that uses the [OneDrive SDK for C#](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp). In this sample, users can browse files and folders that are stored on OneDrive, and view metadata.

## Set up

1. Install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) and all available updates, if you don't already have it. 
2. Download the OneDriveAPIBrowser sample from [GitHub](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp) or create your own fork of the repository.
3. From Visual Studio, open the **OneDriveSdk.sln** project and build it.

## Run the sample

In Visual Studio, select the sample OneDriveAPIBrowser from the Startup project list, and then press **F5** or click **Start** to run the sample. The sample looks like this: 

![OneDriveAPIBrowser sample](https://github.com/mimisasouvanh/onedrive-sdk-csharp/blob/master/samples/OneDriveApiBrowser/images/OneDriveAPIBrowser.PNG)

When the OneDrive API Browser app opens, choose **File** | **Sign in to MSA** to sign in to a personal OneDrive account. Once you have signed in to your Microsoft account, a dialog will appear, asking for permissions to access OneDrive files.

Click **Yes**. 

Your OneDrive items will appear on the left pane, with each item represented by a thumbnail. On the right pane, the selected item's properties are displayed. You can choose how the item properties are displayed, whether its JSON or Tree View.

To upload a file, choose **Upload** from the menu and then choose **Simple - Path-based** to upload by path, or **Simple - ID-based** to upload by item id.

To download a file, select a file, and then choose **Download** from the menu.

The **Picker** menu opens up the signed-in user's OneDrive from a web browser.

## API features

### OneDrive sign-in

This sample gets an **IOneDriveClient** instance using **GetMicrosoftAccountClient**, and calls **AuthenticateAsync** to sign the user in with the specified scopes:

```csharp
private IOneDriveClient oneDriveClient { get; set; }
private static readonly string[] Scopes = { "onedrive.readwrite", "wl.offline_access", "wl.signin" };
...
private async void signInToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{ 
     if (this.oneDriveClient == null) 
     { 
         this.oneDriveClient = OneDriveClient.GetMicrosoftAccountClient( 
             FormBrowser.MsaClientId, 
             "https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf", 
             FormBrowser.Scopes, 
             webAuthenticationUi: new FormsWebAuthenticationUi()); 
     } 

     try 
     { 
         if (!this.oneDriveClient.IsAuthenticated) 
         { 
             await this.oneDriveClient.AuthenticateAsync(); 
         } 
...
```

As you can see, the three scopes specified for `Scopes` invokes the Permissions window. The OneDrive SDK also provides a **SignOutAsync** method to easily sign the user out:

```csharp
await this.oneDriveClient.SignOutAsync();
```

### Get item properties

This sample demonstrates how to get an item's properties, by calling the **GetAsync** method of the **OneDriveClient** object:

```csharp
folder = await this.oneDriveClient.Drive.Root.Request().Expand(expandValue).GetAsync();
```

### Simple item upload

This sample makes use of the OneDrive API's ability to upload items by path or by id. 
Here, you upload an item by path:

```csharp
// Specify the folder path of the item to upload.
string folderPath = targetFolder.ParentReference == null 
 ? "/drive/items/root:" 
 : targetFolder.ParentReference.Path + "/" + Uri.EscapeUriString(targetFolder.Name); 
var uploadPath = folderPath + "/" + Uri.EscapeUriString(System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filename)); 

// Use the OneDrive SDK to upload the item by path.
var uploadedItem = await 
   this.oneDriveClient.ItemWithPath(uploadPath).Content.Request().PutAsync<Item>(stream); 

```

This example shows how to upload an item by id:
```csharp
var uploadedItem = await 
  this.oneDriveClient.Drive.Items[targetFolder.Id].ItemWithPath(filename).Content.Request() 
    .PutAsync<Item>(stream); 
```
